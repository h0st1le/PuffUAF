<h1>Particle Distributions</h1>
This controls the number distribution of particles as a function of height. <b>linear</b> initializes particles evenly from the bottom to the top of the plume. <b>poisson</b> is a poisson distribution with most particles near the top of the plume. The spread of the 'bulge' is determined by the parameter plumeZwidth (in km). <b>exponential</b> initializes most particles at the plume top and exponentially decreases downward until the plume bottom. The parameter plumeZwidth determines how steeply the decrease occurs.
